// Package throttle turns the observed behaviour of a principal into an automated defensive
// response on the signature surface.
//
// An Escalator is both an observer of Signer/Verifier operations and a gate in front of them.
// It watches, per principal, the request rate and the fraction of operations that fail or
// present a rejected signature; when either crosses its configured threshold the principal is
// moved up a level:
//
//	normal  -> full quota
//	soft    -> quota reduced by QuotaReductionFactor, for at least SoftDuration
//	blocked -> operations refused for BlockDuration, then released back to soft
//
// A principal that goes DeescalateAfter without a violation is restored one level at a time.
// Every transition is reported as a sigobserve event, which is what makes alerting possible
// without scraping logs.
//
// Enforcement belongs at the client-facing boundary only. In particular it must not be
// applied inside driver validators: those resolve verifiers while validating a transaction,
// and denying them based on local per-node call history would make validation depend on which
// node performed it. Instrumentation is safe everywhere; the gate is not.
