# OSPS Baseline Level 3

Self-assessment of Panurus against **Level 3** of the
[OpenSSF Security Baseline](https://baseline.openssf.org), version **v2026.02.19**.

- **Assessment date:** 2026-08-03
- **Assessed release:** `v0.16.0`
- **Status legend and methodology:** see the [section overview](README.md)

Level 3 applies to code projects with a large, consistent user base and builds on
[Level 1](baseline_level_1.md) and [Level 2](baseline_level_2.md). It is documented here as a
longer-term target: most of its controls concern release provenance, support lifecycle and formal
security analysis, none of which exist yet. Requirement wording below is abbreviated; the
authoritative text is the
[Baseline v2026.02.19 control list](https://baseline.openssf.org/versions/2026-02-19).

## Access Control

| Control | Requirement | Status | Evidence / notes |
|---------|-------------|--------|------------------|
| `OSPS-AC-04.02` | Jobs are assigned only the minimum privileges necessary | **Partially Met** | Where permissions are declared they are minimal and deliberately scoped — [token-validation-benchmark.yml](https://github.com/LFDT-Panurus/panurus/blob/main/.github/workflows/token-validation-benchmark.yml) keeps a read-only default token and grants `pull-requests: write` only to the job that never executes pull-request code. But [tests.yml](https://github.com/LFDT-Panurus/panurus/blob/main/.github/workflows/tests.yml), [md_links.yml](https://github.com/LFDT-Panurus/panurus/blob/main/.github/workflows/md_links.yml) and [protect-integration-test-types.yml](https://github.com/LFDT-Panurus/panurus/blob/main/.github/workflows/protect-integration-test-types.yml) declare no `permissions:` at all, so their token scope is whatever the repository default happens to be. |

## Build and Release

| Control | Requirement | Status | Evidence / notes |
|---------|-------------|--------|------------------|
| `OSPS-BR-01.04` | Input from trusted collaborators is sanitized and validated before use | **Not Met** | [tests.yml](https://github.com/LFDT-Panurus/panurus/blob/main/.github/workflows/tests.yml) interpolates the `workflow_dispatch` input `fsc-version` directly into a shell step (`go mod edit -replace=...=${{ github.event.inputs.fsc-version }}`, lines 35-37). The input comes from a trusted collaborator, but it is neither validated nor passed through an `env:` variable, which is exactly the pattern this control targets. |
| `OSPS-BR-02.02` | Every asset in a release is clearly associated with the release identifier | **Met** | Releases publish only GitHub's auto-generated source archives, which are named after the tag, and each Go module carries a tag bearing the same version (`v0.16.0`, `cmd/tokengen/v0.16.0`, `integration/v0.16.0`, ...). |
| `OSPS-BR-07.02` | A defined policy for storing, accessing and rotating secrets and credentials | **Not Met** | Workflows consume credentials only through the GitHub `secrets` context, but no document states who may add a secret, how access is reviewed, or when secrets are rotated. |

## Documentation

| Control | Requirement | Status | Evidence / notes |
|---------|-------------|--------|------------------|
| `OSPS-DO-03.01` | Instructions to verify the integrity and authenticity of release assets | **Not Met** | No such instructions exist, and there is nothing to verify against today (see `OSPS-BR-06.01` in [Level 2](baseline_level_2.md)). Module consumers do get `go.sum` checksum verification, which is not documented as a verification procedure. |
| `OSPS-DO-03.02` | Instructions to verify the expected identity of the release author | **Not Met** | Release tags are unsigned, so author identity cannot be verified cryptographically and no procedure is documented. |
| `OSPS-DO-04.01` | A descriptive statement about the scope and duration of support for each release | **Not Met** | [versioning](../development/versioning.md) explains SemVer mechanics, but no page states how long any given minor release is supported. |
| `OSPS-DO-05.01` | A descriptive statement of when releases stop receiving security updates | **Not Met** | No end-of-life or security-support window is documented. |

## Governance

| Control | Requirement | Status | Evidence / notes |
|---------|-------------|--------|------------------|
| `OSPS-GV-04.01` | A documented policy that code collaborators are reviewed before permissions are escalated | **Not Met** | [MAINTAINERS.md](../../MAINTAINERS.md) lists who holds elevated access, and the [LFDT charter](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/about/charter) governs the project, but no repository document describes the review that precedes granting escalated permissions. |

## Quality

| Control | Requirement | Status | Evidence / notes |
|---------|-------------|--------|------------------|
| `OSPS-QA-02.02` | Compiled released assets are delivered with a software bill of materials | **Not Met** | No SBOM is generated or published. Applicability is partly limited because releases currently ship source and Go modules rather than compiled binaries, but the container images and CLI tools built from this repository are not accompanied by an SBOM either. |
| `OSPS-QA-04.02` | Subprojects enforce security requirements at least as strict as the primary codebase | **Met** | Panurus is a single repository with no external subprojects. Its Go modules share one set of gates: `checks.mk` and the `lint` target iterate over `$(GO_MODULES)`, and [tests.yml](https://github.com/LFDT-Panurus/panurus/blob/main/.github/workflows/tests.yml) runs them for the whole tree. The auxiliary `tools` module is the one exception — it appears in `TIDY_GO_MODULES` only, so it is tidy-checked but not linted or vetted. |
| `OSPS-QA-06.02` | Documentation clearly states when and how tests are run | **Met** | [Testing guide](../development/testing.md) covers unit, fuzz, integration and Fabric-X tests with the exact commands; [Makefile guide](../development/makefile.md) documents the targets; the nightly fuzz matrix is described alongside [nightly-fuzz.yml](https://github.com/LFDT-Panurus/panurus/blob/main/.github/workflows/nightly-fuzz.yml). |
| `OSPS-QA-06.03` | A documented policy that major changes add or update automated tests | **Partially Met** | [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) requires a fuzz target for every new parser of untrusted input and describes the expected unit/integration test practice, and [docs/development/testing.md](../development/testing.md) documents how to add tests. Neither [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) nor [DEVELOPMENT.md](../../DEVELOPMENT.md) states the general rule that a major change must come with tests. |
| `OSPS-QA-07.01` | The version control system requires at least one non-author human approval before merge | **Partially Met** | [DEVELOPMENT.md](../../DEVELOPMENT.md) section 3 states a "One Approve Policy", but the active branch ruleset sets `required_approving_review_count: 0`, so the platform does not enforce it; the additional `copilot_code_review` ruleset is an automated review, not a human approval. |

## Security Assessment

| Control | Requirement | Status | Evidence / notes |
|---------|-------------|--------|------------------|
| `OSPS-SA-03.02` | Threat modeling and attack surface analysis of critical code paths | **Not Met** | No threat model is published. Individual hardening notes exist (for example [selector resource limits](../security/selector_resource_limits.md)), and the driver and validator documentation describes trust boundaries, but there is no systematic attack-surface analysis. |

## Vulnerability Management

| Control | Requirement | Status | Evidence / notes |
|---------|-------------|--------|------------------|
| `OSPS-VM-04.02` | Non-exploitable vulnerabilities in components are accounted for in a VEX document | **Not Met** | No VEX documents are produced. |
| `OSPS-VM-05.01` | A documented threshold for remediating SCA findings (vulnerabilities and licenses) | **Not Met** | No documented severity threshold for dependency findings. |
| `OSPS-VM-05.02` | A documented policy to address SCA violations before any release | **Not Met** | The release process does not document a dependency-scanning gate. |
| `OSPS-VM-05.03` | All changes are automatically evaluated against a documented policy for malicious and vulnerable dependencies, and blocked on violation | **Partially Met** | Automated dependency updates are demonstrably active — the `v0.16.0` release notes contain several `build(deps)` pull requests opened by Dependabot. However the repository contains no `.github/dependabot.yml`, the alerting configuration is not publicly readable, no documented policy exists, and no gate blocks a change on a dependency finding. |
| `OSPS-VM-06.01` | A documented threshold for remediating SAST findings | **Partially Met** | The de facto threshold is zero: [codeql-analysis.yml](https://github.com/LFDT-Panurus/panurus/blob/main/.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml) scans every push and pull request, and the `checks` job of [tests.yml](https://github.com/LFDT-Panurus/panurus/blob/main/.github/workflows/tests.yml) fails on any `golangci-lint`, `staticcheck`, `go vet` or `ineffassign` finding. That threshold is not written down anywhere, and CodeQL results are not gated. |
| `OSPS-VM-06.02` | All changes are automatically evaluated for security weaknesses and blocked on violation | **Partially Met** | Evaluation happens on every pull request (CodeQL, `golangci-lint`, `staticcheck`, nightly fuzzing). Blocking is by convention: the only required status check on `main` is `DCO`, and the ruleset that required `CodeQL` is disabled — see `OSPS-QA-03.01` in [Level 2](baseline_level_2.md). |

## Summary

| Status | Count |
|--------|------:|
| Met | 3 |
| Partially Met | 6 |
| Not Met | 12 |
| Unverified | 0 |
| **Total** | **21** |

Level 3 is not a near-term goal. The cheapest wins that also help Level 2 are declaring workflow
`permissions:`, passing the `fsc-version` input through `env:`, and writing down the SAST/SCA
thresholds that CI already enforces in practice. Release signing plus SBOM and VEX generation are the
substantial items.
